Add a new table for playoff results, lets call it playoff_results ** This won't work we are going to have to brainstorm this one.


DATABASE:

Lets change player_to_team, we don't need transfered_from as we can use date to see which order transfers occured in. We don't REALLY need transferred_to either, and these should be teams. Not transfer records.

We do not need is_gm, we should instead make a new table called season_teams or something that tracks this:
	id, team_id, season_id, gm

Season to include finished, winner (maybe auto)

TEAM
	
	Team Name
	Team Shorthand Name
	Arena*
	Description*

	Recent Results
	Upcoming Fixtures

	<Dropdown to select seasons> Format: Season 8 Pro [Season NUM DIV]
	Roster
		Goals
		Assists
		Saves


Team_Season:
	Team team
	Season season
	Player GM


Player -> Team_Season ->
					Season
					Team
					IsGM

Player_To_Team
	TeamSeason -> (Season, TeamID, IsGM)
	Position
	TransferID

TransferLog
	INT TransferID
	Player PlayerID
	ENUM TransferType (Normal, INITIAL 1/Kicked 2/Banned 3)
	TEAM TransferTo (If Null, you're not on any team, you are a free agent)
	TEAM TransferFrom (If null, you transfered from free-agent)
	DateTime Date

Final notes on that:

	Remove transfer_date, is_initial, is_gm*, transfer_to, transfer_from
	add new tables
		Transfer_Log (Independant)
		(Maybe*) Team_Season

	Also I added unique constrant on player_to_team so no duplicates

	Playoff_Fixture round id
	1: Final
	2: Semi-Final
	3: Bronze
	4: QF
	5: R1
