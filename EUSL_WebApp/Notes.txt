Add a new table for playoff results, lets call it playoff_results ** This won't work we are going to have to brainstorm this one.


DATABASE:

Lets change player_to_team, we don't need transfered_from as we can use date to see which order transfers occured in. We don't REALLY need transferred_to either, and these should be teams. Not transfer records.

We do not need is_gm, we should instead make a new table called season_teams or something that tracks this:
	id, team_id, season_id, gm

Season to include finished, winner (maybe auto)

TEAM
